# Politik
<!-- v1 -->

The purpose of  this application is to determine and share politicians individal effect on different communities and demographics. This can be done by analyzing bills and evaluating the effects that each bill will have on these demographics. Each bill will be assigned numerical grades for each demographic representing to what extent it will benefit or disadvantage each demographic. Then depending on how the politician votes on each bill its values will be factored into the politicians cumulative grade for each demographic. Overtime, as more bills and votes are analyzed, we will be able to identify which politicans benefit which communities based on their actions and data as opposed to their words and opinions.

Here is a basic example. Senator John has a low income grade of +40 and a new bill has been proposed that will increase funding for public education. The new bill has been evaluated to have a +5 impact on the low income demographic. If Senator John votes in favor of the bill (regardless of whether or not it passes) his new low income grade will be +45. If he votes agaisnt the bill his new grade will be +35. 

In addition to having demograhic ratings, future developments of the application will give politicians ratings for different universal political issues such as the enviroment, gun control, abortion, etc. as well as allow for government officials such as judges, prosecutors, treasueres etc. 

Will explain grading system later
